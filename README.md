# ðŸŽ¨ Computer Graphics Laboratory - OpenGL

## ðŸ“– Project Description
This repository contains the implementation of laboratory tasks for the **Computer Graphics** course, developed in **C++** using the **OpenGL** API.

The ZIP files are encrypted with the password "grafika". The executable `.exe` files can be run without installing **OpenGL**, provided they are placed in the same folder as the necessary `.dll` libraries. 

However, to run the programs through an IDE, it is necessary to install **OpenGL**.
